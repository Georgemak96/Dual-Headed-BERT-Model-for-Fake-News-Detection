# Truth, Lies and Language Models: Detecting AI-Generated Fake News

In an era where generative AI can produce convincing news articles in seconds, distinguishing truth from fabrication has become more complex than ever. This project tackles the dual challenge of **misinformation detection** and **source attribution**â€”identifying not just whether a news article is fake, but whether it was written by a human or a language model.

## Project Overview

This research introduces a **dual-headed BERT-based classifier** trained on a diverse, multi-source dataset. The model simultaneously performs:
- **Fake vs Real classification**: Is the news factually accurate?
- **Human vs LLM classification**: Was it written by a person or generated by an AI?

By combining these tasks, the model offers a more nuanced understanding of modern misinformation, especially in contexts where AI-generated fake news is designed to mimic human writing styles.

## Dataset Composition

- **Human-written sources**: Six datasets including real and fake news from verified outlets
- **LLM-generated sources**: Articles produced by GPT-3.5, Llama2, and Mistral across multiple prompts and strategies
- **MegaFake**: A challenging test set with highly realistic AI-generated fake news

## Model Architecture & Training

- Based on **BERT-baseT**, modified with two classification heads
- Trained using a **multi-task learning** approach
- Evaluated on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets to test generalization

## Results

| Task               | Accuracy | F1 Score |
|--------------------|----------|----------|
| Fake vs Real       | 85%      | 86%      |
| Human vs LLM       | 96%      | 85%      |

The model shows strong generalization across unseen data and outperforms traditional detectors, especially when faced with sophisticated AI-generated misinformation.

## Why It Matters

- **Scalable detection**: Works across multiple domains and writing styles
- **Future-proof**: Designed to adapt to evolving LLM capabilities
- **Real-world relevance**: Addresses urgent concerns in journalism, social media, and public discourse
